Project Description

This project aims to analyze and predict housing and condo prices in Bangkok using a dataset containing detailed information on property size, price, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, location, and property type. The goal is to uncover patterns and relationships between different property features and their impact on price.

Key Objectives:
Data Cleaning and Exploration:
Load the dataset, handle missing values, and explore the distribution of key property features.
Data Visualization:
Create visualizations to understand the distribution and relationships between property size, price, location, and property type.
Histograms to show the frequency distribution of key features
Correlation heatmap to identify relationships between numerical features
Scatter plots to visualize the relationship between area, price, and property type
Predictive Modeling:
Build and compare two predictive models:
Linear Regression – A simple baseline model to understand the linear relationship between features and price
Random Forest – A more complex model to capture non-linear patterns and improve prediction accuracy
Model Evaluation:
Evaluate model performance using key metrics:
Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
Mean Squared Error (MSE)
R-squared (R²)
Feature Importance Analysis:
Identify the most influential factors affecting property prices using feature importance from the Random Forest model.
Outcome:
This project provides insights into the Bangkok housing market and helps identify key factors influencing property prices. The trained models can be used for price prediction and market trend analysis, offering valuable insights for real estate investors and buyers.
