Project Name: Bangkok Housing Price Prediction
Description:
The Bangkok Housing Price Prediction project aims to build a machine learning model that can predict housing prices for condos, apartments, and houses in Bangkok. The model uses features such as Area (sq. ft.), Bedrooms, and Bathrooms to estimate the price of a property in Thai Baht (THB). The goal is to provide real estate buyers, sellers, and investors with a tool to make informed decisions based on accurate predictions of property prices.

This project involves:

Data Collection & Preprocessing:
The dataset used in this project includes various features of properties in Bangkok, including property type, location, area, and price.
Data cleaning, handling missing values, and removing outliers were performed to ensure that the data is ready for model training.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Statistical analysis was done to understand the distribution of data, identify correlations between features, and visualize key trends (e.g., price variations by property type and location).
Model Training:
A Random Forest Regressor model was trained using the selected features (Area (sq. ft.), Bedrooms, and Bathrooms).
The model was optimized using hyperparameter tuning, and the performance was evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared (R²). The final model achieved high performance with an R² value of 0.99.
Prediction:
The model was used to predict the price of properties based on input features. Predictions are made for a variety of property configurations, and the model can be used interactively.
Results:
The model accurately predicts housing prices, helping users estimate the cost of properties based on their area, number of bedrooms, and bathrooms.
Tools and Technologies:
Python: For data manipulation and modeling.
Pandas: For data preprocessing and analysis.
Matplotlib/Seaborn: For visualizations.
Scikit-learn: For machine learning and model evaluation.
Streamlit: (Optional) For creating a web interface to interact with the model and make predictions.
Key Features:
Interactive Price Prediction: Users can input details such as area, number of bedrooms, and bathrooms to get an estimated property price.
Data Visualization: Provides various charts and graphs to help users understand the relationships between property features and pricing.
Model Performance: The model delivers highly accurate predictions with a low error margin (R² = 0.99).
Objective:
To help real estate professionals and buyers make informed decisions using machine learning to predict property prices based on key features. The project demonstrates the application of data science in real estate and showcases the ability to deploy machine learning models for practical, user-friendly applications.
